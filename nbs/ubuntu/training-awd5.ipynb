      "1. xxbos Welcome to lesson 7 ! The last lesson of part 1 . This will be a pretty intense lesson . Do n't let that bother you because partly what i want to do is to give you enough things to think about to keep you busy until part 2 . In fact , some of the things we cover today , i 'm not going to tell you about some of the details . i 'll just point out a few things . i 'll say like okay that we 're not talking about yet\n",
      "2. the classes of the test set so we 're going to do something very similar here for example if we create a little small subset of a data for playing with this is a really good idea when you start with a new data set so i 've just grabbed two thousand ids at random okay and then i 'm just going to grab a little training set in a little test set half and half of those 2,000 ids and it 's going to grab five columns okay and then we can just play around with this nice and easy\n",
      "3. this nice explanation of how to create a data set using Google images so that was definitely an inspiration for some of the techniques we use here so thank you to Adrian and you should definitely check out his site it 's a really it 's full of lots of good resources so so here we are so we are going to try to create a teddy bear detector thanks we 're going to try and make a teddy bear detector and we 're going to try and separate teddy bears from black bears from grizzly bears now this\n",
      "4. when you 've got to play around with different dropout values for each of your layers to decide so in pretty much every fast AI learner there 's a parameter called p 's PS which will be the p - value for the dropout for each layer so you can just pass in a list or you can pass it an int and it 'll create a list with that value everywhere sometimes it 's a little different for CNN for example it actually if you pass in an int it will use that for the last layer\n",
      "5. i really want to mention this to confirm that there is something called regularization and you can reduce the regularization to avoid underfitting . So for now , just know that by using a number lower than one is because when i first tried to run this , i was under fitting . So if you reduced that number , then it will avoid under fitting . Okay . so we 've got a learner , we can lr_find and looks pretty standard : Then we can fit one cycle . What 's happening here is we\n",
      "6. you can refactor that like so : Keep refactoring your architectures if you 're trying novel architectures because you 'll make less mistakes . Very few people do this . Most research code you look at is clunky as all heck and people often make mistakes in that way , so do n't do that . You 're all coders , so use your coding skills to make life easier . Okay , so there 's my resnet - ish architecture . lr_find as usual , fit for a while , and i get 99.54 % .\n",
